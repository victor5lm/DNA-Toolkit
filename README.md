# DNA-Toolkit
Programming assignment in **Python** developed for the "Programming, Linux and Databases" subject in the MSc Bioinformatics and Computational Biology

This tool, called DNA-Toolkit, allows the user to create random DNA strands, save them in the current directory, load a DNA sequence, delete a file, and
DNA strands, save them in the current directory, load a DNA sequence, delete a file, 
check that a DNA strand is valid, insert point mutations into the DNA strand, measure the frequencies of each nitrogenous base and count
the frequencies of each nitrogenous base and count subsequences in the sequence.
